# BOOK-LIBRARY
 A library is modelled using plain java employing OOP concepts.
 Only the librarian can add book to the library.
 Only teachers and students can borrow books.
 Priority queue is used and twacher's book request is prioritised before students.
 A senior student's book request is prioritised before a junior student's.
A Subsequent repo will suceed this.
